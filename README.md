# Greetings to whoever is reading this
I write code, and I break code.<br>
I can write code in:
- Python (my primary language)
- Rust
- C (Still learning)
- JS/HTMl/CSS (the generic webdev stuff, I suck at proper CSS though)
<br>

Check out abbadon.tech for my work. <br>
If you want to talk, hit me up on twitter (0xApollyon) or discord (0xapollyon)<br><br>
Apart from the work you find on my site, here and twitter, I also do a little bit of finance and economics (was a semifinalist in Wharton Global High School Investment Competition)
